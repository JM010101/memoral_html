                <h2>About the Falling Gators Iniative</h2>
                <p>This page is dedicated to the Fallen Gators Memorial Bench Fundraising Initiative. We were classmates who walked the halls of Grantham High School in St. Catharines between 1977 and 1982. We were the Grantham Gators. That wasn't just a mascot; it was our identity. It meant belonging, pride, and a shared chapter of our lives that still connects us decades later.</p>
                
                <p>This page exists to celebrate the lives of the Gators we have sadly already lost. Each name represents a story, a friendship, a laugh in the hallway, a moment in class, a memory that mattered. These lives were cut far too short, but none are forgotten. Here, we pause to remember who they were and what they meant to us then - and now in spirit.</p>
                
                <p>As you explore this page, take a moment. Reflect. Share a memory if you can. Say a quiet thank you for the time you had together. The Fallen Gators live on in the stories we carry and the respect we show by remembering who they are.</p>
                
                <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.2rem; margin-top: 2rem; color: var(--primary-color);">Once a Gator, always a Gator.</p>

                <h2>The Silent Hero Subsidy</h2>
                <p>The Silent Hero Subsidy exists to support students and teachers who are quietly struggling and doing their best to get through challenging years. These are not headline stories. These are real people facing real obstacles, often without asking for help or drawing attention to themselves.</p>
                
                <p>Fully funded by the Fallen Gators Memorial Benches initiative, the Silent Hero Subsidy transforms remembrance into action. While the benches honour classmates who were taken too soon, this subsidy looks forward. It focuses on helping today's students survive and, where possible, thrive.</p>
                
                <p>Support is directed toward practical, immediate needs identified by school administration. This may include learning supplies, program fees, transportation support, or access to opportunities that would otherwise be out of reach. The goal is simple. Remove barriers so effort, talent, and determination have a fair chance to succeed.</p>
                
                <p>Teachers are included because they are often silent heroes themselves. Many go beyond their job descriptions to support students emotionally, financially, and academically. When teachers are supported, entire classrooms benefit.</p>
                
                <p>The Silent Hero Subsidy is intentionally quiet. There are no spotlights, no public recognition, and no pressure placed on recipients. Dignity matters. Impact matters more than credit.</p>
                
                <p>Every dollar comes from a place of remembrance and responsibility. We cannot change the past, but we can influence the future. By supporting those who need it most, the Silent Hero Subsidy ensures that loss is honoured through hope, compassion, and meaningful action.</p>
                
                <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.2rem; margin-top: 2rem; color: var(--primary-color);">This is how memory becomes momentum.</p>
