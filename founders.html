                    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 2; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                        The Grantham Gators Founders are former students who attended Grantham High School in St. Catharines between 1977 and 1982. Bound by shared experiences, lifelong friendships, and a deep connection to their school, this group came together years later to reflect on what it truly meant to be a Grantham Gator.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 2; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                        This initiative was founded by Curt Skene, a Grantham alumnus who recognized a difficult and sobering reality: far too many classmates had passed away much too soon. What began as reconnection and conversation quickly evolved into a purpose-driven mission. As a group they envisioned a way to honour fallen classmates while creating something lasting, respectful, and meaningful.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 2; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                        Under Curt's leadership, classmates from across different graduating years stepped forward to help bring this memorial site to life. Each founder contributed money, time, skills, and resources, united by a shared belief that remembrance should lead to action. This is a collective effort, built on mutual respect and a strong sense of responsibility to those who are no longer with us.

                    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 2; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                        While the founders are saddened by the number of Fallen Gators, the focus is intentionally forward-looking. Through the Silent Hero Subsidy, the mission extends beyond honouring the past to supporting students today. These quiet acts of assistance are directed where help is needed most and are designed to create real, lasting impact.
